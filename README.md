# 90-Day DSA Roadmap for C++ Programming and Problem Solving

## Overview

This repository provides a structured and systematic approach to learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. The goal is to help you improve your problem-solving skills and prepare for technical job interviews with a daily commitment to learning. The roadmap is divided into week-wise and day-wise plans, with specific topics and problems to solve, ranging from basic to advanced levels.

## Approach to Solving DSA Problems

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem statement thoroughly. Identify the input, output, and constraints.
2. **Plan**: Think about the logic or algorithm. Break down the problem into smaller parts.
3. **Code**: Implement the solution in C++.
4. **Test**: Run the code with different test cases, including edge cases.
5. **Debug**: If the solution doesn't work, debug by checking for logical or syntax errors.
6. **Optimize**: Once the solution works, think about optimizing it for better performance.
7. **Time Allocation**: Spend no more than 60 minutes on a single problem. If unsolved, study the solution, understand the logic, and move on.
